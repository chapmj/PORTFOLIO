# Portfolio
*Central space for showing projects, separate from experiments and miscellaneous works* 

* [SpaceGame] (https://github.com/chapmj/SpaceGame) Reimplementation of a popular arcade title built with Java and JavaFX.   This implementation does not use a game engine and uses JavaFX minimally.  The main goal was to build it from scratch.  This was inspired by some coursework in C# which I wanted to expand upon.

* [MisterShapeSwing](https://github.com/chapmj/MisterShapeSwing) A small "Paint" program. Restructuring to better fit the "MVC" architectures.  Other changes to build based on lesson's learned.

* [Potbelly-DeviceSimulator](https://github.com/chapmj/Potbelly-DeviceSimulator) Designed to simulate an ASTM1394 client. Written in python.  This is a small side-project. ASTM1394 is the standard protocol for transferring data between Clinical Laboratory medical devices.
